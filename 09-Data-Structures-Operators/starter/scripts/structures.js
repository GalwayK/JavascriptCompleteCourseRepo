// Choosing which data structure to use can be difficult. There are essentially 
// three sources of data. 

// 1. From the source code alone. 

// 2. From the user interface, such as the webpage. 

// 3. From external sources, such as a web API. 

// We store data in data structures, so we need a way to decide which data 
// structure to use. 

// If we just need an list of values, we will use a set or an array. 
// If we need to describe our data, we will use objects or maps. 

// If we need a list in order or with duplciates, we should use arrays. 
// If we need to work with unique values, or if we need higher-performance. 

// Objects are the most traditional key value data structure. It is easier to 
// write and access values than it is to access values of maps. Objects can also 
// have methods, while maps cannot. You should also use them when working with 
// JSON.

// Maps offer much better performance, any data type for keys, are easy to 
// iterate, and it is easy to compute their size. They are best used when you 
// simply need a key value store. 

// Arrays, Sets, Objects, and Maps.
