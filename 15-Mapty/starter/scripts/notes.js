// Planning a Web Project 
/*
The step to design a web project typically adhere to the following steps. 

User Stories -> Features -> Flowchart -> Architecture -> Development

User Stories: Descriptions of the application's functionality from the view
of an end user. Putting all of the stories together describes the whole app.
The format is, "As a USER I want to ACTION so I can BENEFIT." For example, 
"As a runner, I want to track my workouts so I can log my progress."

Features: The features the application will need to fulfil the user stories.

Flowchart: The data flow diagram or visual aid to describe the application.

Architecture: The programming logic and structure for the application.
